About the Role
We’re developing a new product currently in a private Beta to support RStudio’s mission of training the next generation of data scientists.

We’re helping learners develop their skills with a mentor-led, computer supported learning environment.
We’re organized as a cross-functional team that involves product management, subject matter experts (educators), and engineers. This role will oversee the design, development, and delivery of educational content to students.
We’ve had great success with early customers but we’re still rapidly iterating and experimenting in order to fully realize the product’s potential. Additionally, we have ambitious plans for scaling this product from dozens of users to thousands over the next year and you’ll be an integral part of making that happen.

As Data Science Educator, you will be responsible for helping employed professionals learn to do data science with R. You will:
Write instructional materials for R users, maintaining a schedule that allows 15-20 hours per week of focused writing time. You will develop content for every step of the learning journey, from tutorials and code recipes, to practice exercises supported by gradethis code for automated feedback, to datasets cleaned and curated for students to use, to large scale data science projects that allow clients to apply what they learn as they learn it.
Mentor small groups of adult learners as they complete apprenticeships with R. Each apprenticeship lasts about 12 weeks and guides a group of 5-7 learners through the tutorials, exercises, and projects that you and your team members will create. As a mentor, you will
Facilitate weekly 1 hour online group sessions where students will share their data science project milestones.
Meet with students online each week, in individual or group office hours, collecting questions ahead of time in a Slack or MS Teams channel.
Create a positive, fun, and judgement free learning environment and encourage active participation. Where appropriate, you will provide students with useful feedback and tips on how to improve their R programming.
