Nordstrom is a specialty retailer offering the very best in fashion and customer service since 1901. Five values guide how we work together and how we deliver analytic insights and data science products. We are customer-obsessed, owners at heart, curious and ever-changing, here to win, and committed to extending ourselves. We understand that our success comes from empowering our employees to set their sights high and deliver exceptional service to our customers.
The Inventory Positioning Data Science team’s mission is to use machine learning and optimization to power Nordstrom’s decision making about where inventory needs to be to best serve customers what they want, where they want it, and when they want it. We predict how much of which types of inventory Nordstrom will have in various locations in the future to enable our merchants and supply chain partners to best serve our customers on their terms. We build and deploy models to allocate inventory to the stores and fulfillment centers that are closest to where we anticipate customers will want it. We collaborate with product management, program management, and engineering colleagues to provide data-driven solutions. We welcome feedback, and we evaluate our products’ performance over time to identify and realize improvements over the long term. In everything we do, we prioritize making a big impact for our customers by improving the selection of products available to them on their terms.
We are committed to building teams that reflect the diversity of our customers, and we understand that active inclusion is central to how Nordstrom wins. We’re an equal opportunity employer and encourage individuals from underrepresented backgrounds to apply!

Data is the future
Businesses create, receive, use and share vast volumes of data.
The data they hold contains more potential than they realise, or that most will likely ever access.
It is too inaccessible, invisible or inconsistent, restraining the potential to improve or innovate.
For data to tell its stories, it needs to be given a platform from which to speak and a voice and language that can be understood.
Calligo gives businesses renewed optimism for their use, control and understanding of data by reconstructing its entire lifecycle.
Calligo creates safe, performant, accessible and unified environments for all forms and sources of data, and reveals its insights throughout the business, sparking a culture of data-driven innovation and creativity.

Data is the future
Businesses create, receive, use and share vast volumes of data.
The data they hold contains more potential than they realise, or that most will likely ever access.
It is too inaccessible, invisible or inconsistent, restraining the potential to improve or innovate.
For data to tell its stories, it needs to be given a platform from which to speak and a voice and language that can be understood.
Calligo gives businesses renewed optimism for their use, control and understanding of data by reconstructing its entire lifecycle.

We're here to make legal help accessible to all. LegalZoom transformed the legal industry with the launch of our online services and groundbreaking technology in 2001. Since then, millions of customers have counted on us to officially start and run businesses, protect brands and intellectual property, and look after loved ones through wills and trusts.
As the industry leader for over 20 years, innovation remains at the center of all we do. We're creative thinkers and problem solvers with a passion for building legal and tax products that make a positive impact on the world, and we're always looking for exceptional people to push us further.
With us, you'll do work that's as rewarding as it is challenging with a team where every voice matters and diversity, equality, and inclusion are truly embraced. Together, we'll continue to democratize the law and make a real difference in the lives of millions.
Overview
Fulfillment is an essential part of how LegalZoom serves its customers. While much of our platform is highly automated, sometimes the complexity of providing services across every state and thousands of counties requires human intervention. In some cases, the difference between whether a customer successfully files for the formation of their new business or gets their estate plans in place is the work performed by our fulfillment team.
As a data scientist working with our fulfillment team, you will help us get better visibility into what happens between the time a customer places an order and they get the products and services that they need from LegalZoom. By better tracking and understanding what happens in fulfillment, we can make it faster and easier for customers to do business with us, drive increased automation of our products and services, and have a positive impact on LegalZoom’s bottom line. While you will initially focus on metrics and strategic recommendations, over time this role has the potential to play a key role in how we automate more of the work done in fulfillment.

As an Product Manager of Analytics, you will support up to SVP*-level decision meetings around approving confidential funding requests (PRFAQs) for brand new devices and services, build decisions around how many hardware devices to manufacture prior to receiving any customer signal, and pricing decisions around how to price and promote products and services. You will leverage Science and Tools produced by the Device Economics team such as conjoint demand models to produce these recommendations.

ABOUT US
What we do:
Dieta uses AI to personalize digestive healthcare for the 11% of the global population that suffers from digestive disorders.
Why we do it:
Several members of our small-but-super-mighty team suffer from IBS. Our product is deeply personal to us. (And no, you do not have to have IBS to join us, but we WILL inundate you with IBS talk!)
We are disrupting a $136B industry by making managing IBS easier for ALL stakeholders (from patients, to clinicians, to employers, to insurers). There is no “us-against-them” in our solution - literally everyone is a winner when we get involved!
How we do it:
We provide a platform that supports individuals suffering from IBS with managing their symptoms by providing (1) 1-on-1 coaching, (2) guided connection to specialists (from dieticians to gastroenterologists!), and (3) personalized recommendations based on an individual’s own raw data. Our AI mobile application captures high-resolution data on an individual’s diet, bowel movements, medications, and other factors, and generates precise treatment recommendations, along with datasets that are unique to the individual and can be reviewed by their clinicians at any point.
